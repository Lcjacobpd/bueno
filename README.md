# bueno: Automated, Reproducible Benchmarking and Analysis

System benchmarking provides a means to compare or assess the performance of
hardware or software against a point of reference. Because of the multitude of
factors that ultimately influence a benchmarkâ€™s results, reproducibility is
challenging. To aid in this, we present an extensible software framework named
bueno that provides mechanisms to record and automate many arduous, error-prone
benchmarking tasks: environmental discovery, environmental setup, program
compilation, program execution, data storage, and analysis. More on this later.
